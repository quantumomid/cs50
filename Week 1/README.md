# Week 1

These are my solutions and code corresponding to week 1 of the course. 

To run any of the C files, first compile (with link to cs50 if this library is used) and then run. 

For example, if you want to run my solution for lab1, first go inside the `lab1` directory in your terminal. 

Then run the command `clang population.c -o population -lcs50` to compile the C code. Then run `./population` to run the compiled code.
